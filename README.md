# Sorting Visualizer

A simple sorting visualizer built using javascript and the React framework.

Bubble sort, Heap sort, Merge sort and Quick sort are the 4 algorithms that are visualized in this app.

Bubble Sort:
  Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the intended order. Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.
  
Heap Sort:
  Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.
  
Merge Sort:
  Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by dividing the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merging them to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
  
Quick Sort:
  Quick sort is a divide and conqure, in-place sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort
